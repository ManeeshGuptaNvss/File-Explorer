# File-Explorer
- Developed a terminal based File explorer which works in two modes. The application will start in normal mode.
- Normal mode is the default mode and used to explore the current directory and navigate around using the arrow keys and enter key.
- The last line of the display screen is used as status bar in the respective modes and helps with commands.
